# Vue

## Packages
- [Portal Vue][0] -  A feature-rich Portal Plugin for Vue 2, for rendering DOM outside of a component, anywhere in your app or the entire document.
- [Vue Fragment][1] - fragments are basically root-less components. They come useful in many situations where you don't want to pollute the DOM with a useless container, or you want to return many elements at once. :smile:
